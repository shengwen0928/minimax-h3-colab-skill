# MiniMax H3 Colab Skill

This repository is a complete, standalone Codex skill for creating short MiniMax H3 Ref2VA videos from local reference images through Google Colab. Clone it, install the skill, authenticate the Colab CLI, and invoke the included runner or shell launcher. The repository contains:

- `SKILL.md`: the instructions Codex loads when this skill is selected;
- `scripts/runner.py`: the session, usage, upload, batch, download, and cleanup runner;
- `assets/MiniMax_H3_Turbo_Colab.ipynb`: the notebook executed on the remote Colab runtime;
- `run_colab_inference.sh`: a convenient single-video launcher;
- `install.sh`: a portable, non-destructive skill installer;
- `tests/test_runner.py`: offline tests using a fake Colab CLI.

The local machine only prepares and uploads inputs. Model inference runs on the Colab GPU and the finished MP4 is downloaded back to the path you choose.

## Requirements

- A working Codex installation. The skill is installed into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` when `CODEX_HOME` is set, otherwise into `~/.codex/skills`.
- Python 3.11 or newer for the bundled runner. The runner uses only the Python standard library.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installing the Colab CLI, or another supported way to put `colab` on `PATH`.
- [`google-colab-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/google-colab-cli/). The runner was validated with Colab CLI 0.7.4 and uses the documented `version`, `usage`, `new`, `upload`, `exec`, `download`, and `stop` commands. The current CLI release requires Python 3.12 or newer; `uv` can install that interpreter separately from the runner's Python 3.11+ requirement.
- A Google account with access to Colab compute units and a GPU shape that can be allocated. An A100 or equivalent high-memory runtime may require the appropriate Colab plan and available balance.

The optional `ffprobe` program is used to verify that a downloaded MP4 contains both video and audio streams. If `ffprobe` is not installed, the runner still checks that the file exists and is non-empty. Joining several clips into one video requires `ffmpeg` (on Ubuntu, `sudo apt install ffmpeg`, which also installs `ffprobe`).

## Clone and install the skill

```bash
git clone <repository-url> minimax-h3-colab-skill
cd minimax-h3-colab-skill
./install.sh
```

The installer copies the required skill files to:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/skills/minimax-h3-colab
```

When `CODEX_HOME` is unset, the destination is `~/.codex/skills/minimax-h3-colab`.

Use an explicit skills directory when testing or when your Codex configuration is elsewhere:

```bash
./install.sh --dest /absolute/path/to/codex/skills
```

The default operation is idempotent and non-destructive. If the destination already exists, the installer leaves it unchanged and exits successfully. To replace it deliberately, use `--force`; the old directory is first moved to a timestamped `.backup.*` path so it can be recovered:

```bash
./install.sh --force
```

The installer uses a temporary directory and an atomic rename for a new installation. It never copies the repository's Git metadata, tests, README files, or generated output into the installed skill; only `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` are installed.

After installation, start a new Codex turn or reload the skill list if your Codex client caches available skills. The skill name is `minimax-h3-colab`.

## Install and authenticate Colab CLI

Install the CLI as a user tool:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv tool install --python 3.12 google-colab-cli
```

Confirm that it is available:

```bash
colab version
```

The runner defaults to OAuth2. Trigger the first authorization and inspect the account balance with:

```bash
colab --auth=oauth2 usage
```

Follow the URL and code instructions printed by the CLI. The token is stored by the CLI in its normal local configuration; do not put credentials, tokens, or browser state in this repository, a prompt, or a job manifest. If your environment already uses Google Application Default Credentials, choose the alternative provider explicitly:

```bash
COLAB_AUTH=adc colab --auth=adc usage
```

The runner passes `--auth="$COLAB_AUTH"` to every Colab command. Its default is `oauth2`.

## Single-video inference

Create a UTF-8 text file such as `prompt.txt`, then run:

```bash
./run_colab_inference.sh \
  --image /absolute/path/reference_1.png \
  --image /absolute/path/reference_2.jpg \
  --prompt /absolute/path/prompt.txt \
  --output /absolute/path/intro.mp4
```

The first image is exposed to the notebook as `<Picture 1>`, the second as `<Picture 2>`, and so on. Pass 1–9 non-empty image files. The prompt file must be non-empty UTF-8 text and is uploaded unchanged. If `--output` is omitted, the MP4 is written next to the first reference image with a `_minimax_h3.mp4` suffix.

The default clip length is 12 seconds. Set `H3_DURATION_SECONDS` to a value from 4 through 15:

```bash
H3_DURATION_SECONDS=8 ./run_colab_inference.sh \
  --image /absolute/path/reference.png \
  --prompt /absolute/path/prompt.txt
```

The shell launcher requests an A100 high-memory runtime by default. These environment variables change the request:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLAB_AUTH` | `oauth2` | Colab CLI auth strategy: `oauth2` or `adc` |
| `COLAB_GPU` | `A100` | GPU name passed to `colab new` |
| `COLAB_HIGH_MEM` | `1` | Set to `0` to omit `--high-mem` |
| `COLAB_EXEC_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Per-notebook execution timeout in seconds |
| `COLAB_SESSION_NAME` | generated | Reusable session name for the runner |
| `H3_DURATION_SECONDS` | `12` | Clip duration, from 4 to 15 seconds |

## Batch inference

For several clips, keep all jobs in one manifest so they reuse one Colab session and the loaded model. Example `jobs.json`:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "intro",
      "title": "Presenter introduction",
      "reference_images": [
        "/absolute/path/girl-front.png",
        "/absolute/path/girl-side.png"
      ],
      "prompt_file": "/absolute/path/intro-prompt.txt",
      "duration_seconds": 8,
      "output_name": "intro"
    },
    {
      "id": "demo",
      "title": "CLI demo",
      "reference_images": ["/absolute/path/girl-front.png"],
      "prompt": "A concise Ref2VA prompt referring to <Picture 1>.",
      "duration_seconds": 12,
      "output_name": "demo"
    }
  ]
}
```

Run the batch from the cloned repository:

```bash
python3 scripts/runner.py batch \
  --manifest /absolute/path/jobs.json \
  --gpu A100 \
  --timeout 10800 \
  --output-dir /absolute/path/outputs \
  --progress /absolute/path/outputs/progress.json
```

The runner validates all local inputs before starting. It uploads each job's references and prompt, executes the bundled notebook, downloads and verifies the MP4, and continues with the next job. A later failure does not delete completed outputs. A session created by the batch is stopped during cleanup, including after an error or timeout. If you pass `--session NAME` to reuse an existing session, add `--stop-on-complete` when that session should be stopped after the queue.

The installed skill can also be invoked directly without the cloned repository:

```bash
python3 "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/minimax-h3-colab/scripts/runner.py" \
  batch --manifest /absolute/path/jobs.json --output-dir /absolute/path/outputs
```

### Joining clips into a longer video

A single H3 clip is at most 15 seconds. For a longer video, split the story into several jobs in one manifest and add `--concat`:

```bash
python3 scripts/runner.py batch \
  --manifest /absolute/path/jobs.json \
  --output-dir /absolute/path/outputs \
  --concat /absolute/path/outputs/full.mp4
```

- Clips are joined in manifest job order; the individual clips are kept.
- With `--concat`, the runner checks that `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are available and that there are at least two jobs before creating a session, so a missing prerequisite does not waste compute.
- Joining runs only when every job completed. If any job fails, joining is skipped and the result reports `concat.status` as `skipped`.
- Before joining, the runner uses `ffprobe` to compare each clip's codecs, frame size, frame rate, and audio format. Identical clips are joined with a fast stream copy; otherwise they are re-encoded with H.264/AAC, scaling and padding every clip to the first clip's frame size and converting audio to the first clip's format. (ffmpeg stream-copies mismatched clips without reporting an error but produces a file that breaks during playback, so falling back only on failure is not enough.)
- Each clip is generated independently, so motion and lighting are not continuous across joins; placing each join at a shot change looks more natural. Each clip's `non_diegetic_music` is also generated separately, so consider requesting no score and adding one continuous music track after joining.

Existing clips can also be joined directly, for example after re-running the jobs a partial batch missed:

```bash
python3 scripts/runner.py concat \
  --output /absolute/path/outputs/full.mp4 \
  /absolute/path/outputs/part1.mp4 /absolute/path/outputs/part2.mp4
```

## Prompt and image rules

- Each job needs 1–9 non-empty local reference images.
- Image order is stable and is the only mapping used for `<Picture N>` tags.
- A prompt file is read as UTF-8 and sent as the complete prompt; the runner does not translate, summarize, or rewrite it.
- A prompt cannot refer to a picture number greater than the number of images uploaded for that job.
- Each video duration must be between 4 and 15 seconds.
- For guided prompts in another application, use the runner's `compose_ref2va_prompt` helper to produce `subject_definitions`, `summary`, `retention_analysis`, ordered shot blocks, `overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music`.
- The reference image guide is available in the [MiniMax H3 Ref2VA prompt guide](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3/blob/main/docs/VIDEO_PROMPT_WRITING_GUIDE_ref_en.md).

Reference images describe visual identity and appearance. They do not automatically create shot timestamps; describe timing and camera changes in the prompt.

## Direct notebook use

`assets/MiniMax_H3_Turbo_Colab.ipynb` is the exact notebook the runner uploads and executes. It can also be opened manually in Colab for inspection or debugging. The runner's environment variables select reference mode, remote image paths, prompt path, duration, seed, output path, and execution timeout. Keep the notebook copy in this repository with the runner so the two stay compatible.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `colab` is missing | Run `uv tool install google-colab-cli`, then ensure the uv tool bin directory is on `PATH`. |
| OAuth or usage fails | Run `colab --auth=oauth2 usage` interactively and complete the printed Google authorization flow. |
| GPU allocation fails | Check Colab plan, compute-unit balance, requested GPU, and high-memory availability. Try `--no-high-mem` or another supported GPU. |
| A batch times out | Do not blindly retry while the remote kernel may still be running. The runner attempts to stop a session it owns and records completed jobs in progress state. |
| Prompt picture validation fails | Match `<Picture N>` to the 1-based order of the 1–9 `reference_images` entries. |
| Output exists but is rejected | Install `ffprobe` and inspect the downloaded file's video and audio streams. |

## Offline validation

No GPU or Colab session is needed to run the repository tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/runner.py --help
./run_colab_inference.sh --help
```

The tests replace `colab`, `ffprobe`, and `ffmpeg` with local fakes, so they do not spend compute units or access credentials.

## Scope and safety

This repository does not contain Google credentials, tokens, model weights, or generated videos. Colab sessions consume the account's compute units. Do not place secrets in prompts, manifests, logs, or uploaded files. Review the requested GPU and timeout before starting a real batch.
