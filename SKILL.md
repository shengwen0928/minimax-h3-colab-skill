# MiniMax H3 on Colab

Use the bundled notebook and `scripts/runner.py` to generate Ref2VA video from local reference images. The Colab CLI must be installed and authenticated with an available compute-unit balance and GPU allocation.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the requested images and any supplied prompt file. Keep image order stable: image 1 maps to `<Picture 1>`, image 2 to `<Picture 2>`, through image 9.
2. If the user supplied a prompt file, pass it through unchanged. Otherwise write a complete Ref2VA prompt with `subject_definitions`, `summary`, `retention_analysis`, `detailed_description` shot blocks, `overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music`; include dialogue in its shot with `<d>[Chinese] ...</d>` when requested. Use the bundled runner's `compose_ref2va_prompt` helper for structured shot input.
3. Check Colab access and balance with `python3 scripts/runner.py usage --json`. Sufficient compute units do not guarantee that Colab will allocate the requested GPU or high-memory runtime. Report allocation failures plainly.
4. Put the jobs in a UTF-8 JSON manifest and run one batch. The runner uploads each job's images and prompt, executes the bundled notebook sequentially on the same live session, downloads each MP4, and stops the session when it created it. If reusing a session, pass `--stop-on-complete` when the user wants it stopped after the batch.
5. Confirm each output exists and report its local path. Preserve completed clips if a later job fails.
6. When the user wants a video longer than 15 seconds, split it into ordered jobs in one manifest and pass `--concat /absolute/path/outputs/full.mp4` to join the clips in manifest order after every job completes (requires `ffmpeg`). Place joins at shot changes and avoid per-clip background music, since each clip is generated independently. To join existing clips, run `python3 scripts/runner.py concat --output OUT.mp4 CLIP1.mp4 CLIP2.mp4 ...`.

Example manifest:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "title": "intro",
      "reference_images": ["/absolute/path/girl.jpg"],
      "prompt_file": "/absolute/path/prompt.txt",
      "duration_seconds": 12,
      "output_name": "intro"
    }
  ]
}
```

Run from this skill directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/runner.py batch --manifest /absolute/path/jobs.json --gpu A100 --timeout 10800 --output-dir /absolute/path/outputs
```

Use `--no-high-mem` when high-memory allocation is unavailable or not desired. For a named existing session, add `--session SESSION --stop-on-complete` if the requested workflow should end that session.

## Operational limits

- Each job requires 1–9 non-empty reference images, a non-empty UTF-8 prompt, and a duration from 4–15 seconds.
- For YouTube Shorts or other vertical video, set `"orientation": "portrait"` at the manifest top level (768 × 1376); jobs may override it. The default is `"landscape"` (1376 × 768).
- Keep all jobs in one batch to reuse the same Colab session and loaded ComfyUI/model state.
- Do not blindly retry a timed-out `colab exec`: the remote kernel may still be working. The runner stops the session during cleanup and records completed jobs before reporting the failure.
- Do not expose OAuth credentials or runtime tokens in prompts, manifests, browser state, or logs.
- The bundled `assets/MiniMax_H3_Turbo_Colab.ipynb` is the inference notebook used by the runner.
